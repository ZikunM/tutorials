GitHub Tutorial 2 (gh2)
================

The goal of **gh2** is to interact with GitHub from RStudio.

This tutorial is for those with a GitHub account, that have already installed Git (Git is the engine of GitHub), R and RStudio; these people configured it all but haven't fully incorporated these tools into their workflow.

If you haven't yet installed Git and configured Git, follow this instructions for its **Initial Set Up**: <https://github.com/forestgeo/learn/issues/31>.
