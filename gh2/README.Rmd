```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

The goal of __gh2__ is to interact with GitHub from RStudio.

This tutorial is for those with a GitHub account, that have already installed Git (Git is the engine of GitHub), R and RStudio; these people configured it all but haven't fully incorporated these tools into their workflow.

If you haven't yet installed Git and configured Git, follow this instructions for its __Initial Set Up__: https://github.com/forestgeo/learn/issues/31.

## Outline

- Quickly review GitHub Tutorial 1.
- Get GitHub username of those who haven't yet contacted me via GitHub. 
- Create, clone and fork repos
- Pull, push, download, upload content
- Time travel
